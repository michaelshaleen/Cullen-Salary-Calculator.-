# Project Name

Employee Salary Calculator

## Description

Your project description goes here. What problem did you solve? How did you solve it?

\*\* In this application we are able to quickly and easily find the Monthly Cost a business is spending on employee's salaries. We solved this conundrum by using the culmination of employee's annual salaries divided by the twelve months of the year. The monthly cost, along with all other employee data will be visible on the webpage and can easily be recorded and shared with other personnel.

Additional README details can be found [here](

## User instructions##

Utilize the input fields and accurately fill them out with the employee's information. After pressing the submit button, you'll see the information stored on the page along with an up to date product of the total monthly expenses. Currently, if the monthly spending is over $20,000 you will be notified and see a red highlight in the corresponding data.
